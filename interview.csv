"196",46344,"told me he was going a journey, I should say “With what porpoise?”’
"
"197",92946,"‘And that’s the jury-box,’ thought Alice, ‘and those twelve creatures,’

"
"225",40590,"‘Swim after them!’ screamed the Gryphon.
"
"226",16328,"‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my gloves this moment!’

"1056",15992,"This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little

"1063",56894,"‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’
"
"1064",76161,"Alice was thoroughly puzzled. ‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated

"1065",14771,"‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.

"1067",45861,"‘I think I should understand that better,’ Alice said very politely, ‘if

"
"3101",13954,"to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right

"3110",46178,"like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice

"3147",78218,"‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you could keep it to

"3156",33156,"
"
"3157",35846,"‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
"
"3158",93919,"  But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance--
"
"3159",49536,"
"
"3160",45671,"a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
"
"3161",29739,"down yet, before the trial’s begun.’
"
"3162",99866,"‘I’m afraid I am, sir,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t remember things as I

"3163",11761,"‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
"
"3164",30680,"corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with

"3165",56418,"‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting

"3166",86500,"forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
"
"3167",31094,"and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
"
"3168",53656,"She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt

"3169",98110,"    Pray how did you manage to do it?’

"3170",30199,"
"
"3171",34036,"going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
"
"3172",45880,"
"
"3173",61326,"she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
"
"3174",76612,"
"
"3175",41660,"held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
"
"3176",78918,"OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
"
"3177",65685,"wondering very much what would happen next.

"3178",64776,"suppose it doesn’t mind.’
"
"3179",18007,"   A secret, kept from all the rest,
"
"3180",89587,"
"
"3181",24406,"changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
"
"3182",38234,"that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
"
"3183",50806,"turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
"
"3184",28679,"next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’
"
"3185",93387,"‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice.

"3207",19245,"‘You are not attending!’ said the Mouse to Alice severely. ‘What are you

"3208",15149,"
"
"3209",15027,"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in

"3210",78181,"
"
"3211",70933,"before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper

"3214",12354,"
"
"3215",20628,"and holding it to his ear.
"
"3216",30274,"‘Is that the way YOU manage?’ Alice asked.

"3217",62708,"confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste

"3218",82468,"

"3219",39119,"mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,

"3220",77423,"
"
"3221",50092,"same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
"
"3222",76506,"how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among

"3223",16568,"‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.
"
"3224",57138,"then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at

"3225",59309,"
"
"3226",53463,"‘I can’t go no lower,’ said the Hatter: ‘I’m on the floor, as it is.’

"3227",52307,"
"
"3228",47112,"forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is
"
"3229",86055,"down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

"3230",46602,"very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly

"3231",82184,"   My notion was that you had been

"3232",53954,"Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep ‘Twinkle,

"3234",99840,"
"
"3235",39818,"birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
"
"3236",23889,"And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of

"3237",66789,"‘I couldn’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven jogged my

"3243",80921,"
"
"3244",87547,"did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
"
"3245",96214,"‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’
"
"3246",55538,"Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
"
"3247",20151,"to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops

"3257",26924,"‘But, it goes on “THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,”’ said Alice.

"3258",62661,"next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I’m

"3262",58778,"‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said Alice desperately: ‘he’s
